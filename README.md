- Supports various versions of DDEX schemas fetched dynamically from the DDEX directory.
- Displays detailed validation errors if the XML file does not conform to the selected schema.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/musictechlab/mtl-ddexvalidator.git
   cd mtl-ddexvalidator
   ```

2. **Set Up Poetry Environment**

   If you don't have Poetry installed, you can install it using the following command:

   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies Using Poetry**

   Run the following command to install all dependencies:

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   Poetry automatically creates a virtual environment for your project. Activate it using:

   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```

5. **Set Up Django Environment**

   Update the settings file if needed (i.e., `ddexvalidator/settings.py`) with your database or other configurations.

   Apply migrations to set up the database:

   ```bash
   poetry run python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Run the Development Server**

   ```bash
   poetry run python manage.py runserver
   ```

   Access the app at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Usage

1. **Upload an XML File or Paste XML Content**
   - Choose a DDEX schema version from the dropdown.
   - Either upload a DDEX XML file or paste the XML text.
   - Submit the form for validation.
   
2. **View the Validation Results**
   - If the XML is valid, a success message will be displayed along with the formatted XML.
   - If invalid, detailed error messages will be shown indicating the issues with the XML.

## Running Tests

1. **Install `pytest` and `pytest-django` Using Poetry**

   If you haven't already installed the test dependencies, use:

   ```bash
   poetry add --dev pytest pytest-django
   ```

2. **Run the Tests**

   ```bash
   poetry run pytest
   ```

   This will execute all the tests defined in the application.
